    *   Bookings are stored in Firebase Cloud Firestore.
*   **Billing:**
    *   Generate bills for active bookings.
    *   Automatically calculates the total amount based on room type and duration of stay.
    *   Updates booking status to 'completed' upon bill generation and checkout.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Flutter
*   **Backend:** Firebase (Cloud Firestore for database, Firebase Core for initialization)
*   **State Management:** Implied StatefulWidget usage for local UI state.
*   **Date & Time:** `intl` package for date formatting.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application. To run it, you will need to have Flutter installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

*   Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
*   A configured Firebase project with Cloud Firestore enabled.
    *   You will need to replace the placeholder Firebase configuration in `lib/main.dart` with your own project's credentials:
        ```dart
        await Firebase.initializeApp(
          options: FirebaseOptions(
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // Replace with your API key
            appId: "YOUR_APP_ID", // Replace with your App ID
            messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID", // Replace
            projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID" // Replace
          )
        );
        ```
    *   Ensure your Firebase project has a 'bookings' collection for the app to function correctly.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd lucky_resort
    ```

2.  **Get Flutter packages:**
